# Age and Gender Detection

A machine learning model that can predict a person's age and gender from a single image or video. The project is divided into two parts:

1. **Part 1**: A model trained on the UTKFace dataset, which consists of over 20,000 images of faces labeled with age and gender. This model uses deep learning techniques to extract features from the images and make accurate predictions.

2. **Part 2**: A real-time implementation of the model using a webcam or video feed. The model is trained on the same dataset as Part 1 and uses the same techniques, but it is optimized for real-time performance.
